Before entering this topic [Rules and Agreement], there is something that I'd like for you to let me be clear. Minecraft is a game where players can make and destroy objects. In the case of playing together with other users (multiplay), you can, together with partners, make objects, destroy objects that your partners made, and your partners can also do the same with yours. Because of this, please do not play together with people who take actions that you do not like. Sometimes, there are people who do things that should not be done. Although it is not something that you like, besides requesting as favor from everyone to take suitable actions, what this company can do is not many. This company depends on reports from everyone who is a user that grasps reflected difference in deeds. In case there are persons who take unsuitable actions, and if there is anyone who reflects difference in the rules, agreements, etc, in case is thought of as not using suitably Minecraft, by all means, please notify this company. This company has prepared a reflected difference report system for those cases. If we receive your report, we shall discuss the necessary corresponding response.

In reporting the problem, please inform us via support@mojang.com using electronic mail with as much detail as possible the user information and list of deeds, etc.
