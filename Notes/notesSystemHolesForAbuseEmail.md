# NOTES: SYSTEM Holes for Abuse using GMAIL

EMAIL SYSTEM

## Example Sent FEEDBACK to GOOGLE

> Hallo, 
>
> I observed the computer (Windows 7)'s system clock can be CHANGED to cause a sent EMAIL's DATETIME STAMP to be also CHANGED; 
>
> Example: set to 2022-12-25, where: CORRECT VALUE is 2022-12-28; 
>
> Problem occurs when sender claims that EMAIL as REPLY was sent at the set DATETIME; 
>
> requests: using INTERNET TIME, e.g. time.windows.com, to auto-verify the DATETIME of the EMAIL to be sent;
>
> Thank you. Health!
