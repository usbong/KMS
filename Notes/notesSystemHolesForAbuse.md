# NOTES: SYSTEM Holes for Abuse

## Objective: SYSTEM EFFICIENCY

## OBSERVATION: 

EXCESS/MISSING in ACTUAL TOTAL, <br/>
NOT EXACT (even centavo coins)

### Example

Excess 460PHP in ACTUAL TOTAL

## NOTE

IF 500PHP NOT ENTERED IN COMPUTER OR CASH REGISTER, 
TOTAL WILL BE MISSING 40<br/>
<br/>
--> adds: received non-med item price is quickly changeable in computer and cash register<br/>
--> due: to there exists variation in item prices for items of the same classification, e.g. lumbar support<br/>
<br/>
--> keyphrase: holes for abuse in the system<br/>
<br/>
--> adds: continuous occurence of incident causes need to identify CORRECT ACTION to fix the problem<br/>

### ADDITIONAL NOTES:
1) <b>excess CHANGE</b> given to paying patient for item causes <b>MISSING in ACTUAL TOTAL</b>;<br/>
--> Example: <b>300PHP</b> (200BILL + 100BILL), instead of 200PHP (100BILL *2)

2) <b>missing CHANGE</b> given to paying patient for item causes <b>EXCESS in ACTUAL TOTAL</b>;<br/>
--> Example: <b>200PHP</b> (100BILL *2), instead of 300PHP (100BILL + 200BILL)

### REMINDER:
DECEIT becomes increasingly effective with 2 persons, instead of only 1<br/>
--> adds: however, increase of members classified as non-contributing<br/> 
--> causes: increase in need for DECEIT,<br/>
--> due to : NEED of QUICK MONEY;<br/>
--> keyphrase: REPEATING CRIMINAL ACTIONS, noticeable pattern, FRAUD detected;<br/>
<br/>
--> reminder: ONLINE BANKING; When MONEY COUNT becomes NOT SECURE,<br/>
--> via: UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, continuous, repeating CRIMINAL ACTION,<br/>
--> e.g. viewing of MONEY COUNT supposedly classified to be SECURE,<br/>
--> causes: DEATH of CRIMINAL MEMBERS;<br/>
--> due to: <b>VALUE of SECURITY of MONEY COUNT</b> has become <b>ZERO</b>;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TO-DO: -add: more of such observations
