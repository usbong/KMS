# Steps to convert a Portable Document Format (PDF) file to .txt file

## Steps:
1) Open the PDF file using the [Mozilla Firefox Web Browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).</br>
2) Right click the page -> "Save Page As...".</br>
3) Set for the "Save as type:" field, "All Files".</br>
4) Write for the "File name:" field, "<filename>.txt".</br>
--> Note: Include the quotation marks.</br>

## Notes:
1) Adobe Acrobat Reader DC can also convert the PDF file into a .txt file.</br>
--> However, we learned that there are select vital data that are lost, e.g. values in column 1 of page 2 of the PDF file.</br>
2) We shall use another set of instructions for the computer to automatically extract select data values, e.g. name.</br>
--> In this case, we may not anymore include other data, e.g. width and height of each cell of a table column.</br>
