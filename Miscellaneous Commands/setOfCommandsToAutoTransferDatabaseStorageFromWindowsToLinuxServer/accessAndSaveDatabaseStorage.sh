# Notes:
# 1) Update Source location
# source: from Windows machine, e.g. Windows 7, Service Pack 1
#
# 2) Using "mount" command to enable access to source folder in "mnt" directory reduces elapsed time from 4mins to 22seconds
# This is instead of for example: source="/run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share:server=mosc-accounting,share=information%20desk/*"

# Notes:
# 1) Verify that cifs-utils, is installed
# --> We use the mount.cifs Linux command
# --> CIFS = Common Internet File System
# --> Command: sudo aptitude install cifs-utils
#
# 2) Unmount command: umount -l $destination
#--> where: l=lazy, i.e. unmount filesystem now even if busy
