# Notes:
# 1) Verify that cifs-utils, is installed
# --> We use the mount.cifs Linux command
# --> CIFS = Common Internet File System
# --> Command: sudo aptitude install cifs-utils
#
# 2) Unmount command: umount -l $destination
#--> where: l=lazy, i.e. unmount filesystem now even if busy

#make destination folder
sudo mkdir /mnt/myMOSC-AccountingFolder/

#update source location
#source: from Windows machine, e.g. Windows 7, Service Pack 1
#Example:
#source="//192.168.11.55/accounting/"
source="//192.168.11.55/information desk/"

echo "source: "$source

#update destination location
#destination: to Linux machine, e.g. LUBUNTU 20.04 LTS
destination="/mnt/myMOSC-AccountingFolder/"

echo "destination: "$destination

#Note: add quotation marks, e.g. in $source
#TO-DO: add: auto-read from external file password=halimbawaValue
sudo mount -t cifs "$source" "$destination" -o user=unit_member
